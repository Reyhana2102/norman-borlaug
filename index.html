            varieties for each major climate on Earth.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season,

            <b>1953</b> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a
            high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of
            wheat to the indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass

            University.

            <b>2005</b> - States "We will have to double the world food supply
            by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we
            can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM
            crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
            modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called
            it science, people were selecting the best breeds.".
          </li>
          <li><b>2009</b> - Dies at the age of 95.</li>
